Submarine Adventure (swe: Ubåtsäventyret) was developed as a task for Blekinge Insititute to exhibit virtual reality at ForskarFredag (swe: Science Friday) 2016 at Kreativum in Karlshamn, an exhibition for a bunch of cool science-related stuff, and in this case; virtual reality.

The game is made for HTC Vive where the player scoops coal from a dispenser to put in the oven and power the submarine. The submarine can then be driven with the onboard controls (not shown on screenshots) to discover the bottom of the sea.
