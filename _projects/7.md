This project was made by 5 students at BTH, Blekinge Institute of Technology, during the course ME1587 In-depth study. The project as a whole is about exploring the possibility of being able to bury your close in space and thereby discovering new planets that may sustain life. 

It is an interesting concept which in practice can contribute greatly to our exploration of not only our solar system but also of our galaxy. By reviving such funeral burials, we can get a better picture of our galaxy and maybe even find new planets that can sustain life. This, in turn, can lead us to go there in the future and set up settlements and move humans from a slowly dying planet to another where we hopefully do not make the same mistakes as on this.
